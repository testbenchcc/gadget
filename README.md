### Installing Python Packages

Due to restrictions in the Raspberry Pi OS, it's advisable to avoid using `pip` for system-wide installations. Instead, install Python packages using the package manager with:


```bash
sudo apt install python3-[package-name]
```


Replace `[package-name]` with the specific name of the package you wish to install. This method ensures compatibility and proper integration with the system.

### Adding a Cron Job

To ensure the system maintains a Wi-Fi connection, you can add a script to run every minute using cron. Edit the root user's crontab with:


```bash
sudo crontab -e
```


Add the following line to schedule the script to run every minute:


```bash
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/wifi-up.sh
```


Ensure you use `sudo` to edit the root crontab, so the job is added for the root user.

### Adding a Service

To run scripts automatically at system startup, add them as services. This approach is useful for tasks like keeping the display updated. First, create a service file, for example:


```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/show-time-wifi.service
```


Add the following content to the service file:


```ini
[Unit]
Description=Show Time and WiFi on E-Ink Display
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=user
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'python3 show-time-wifi.py'
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


Replace `/path/to/your/script.sh` with the actual path to your script. Then, reload the systemd manager configuration and enable the service to start on boot:


```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable show-time-wifi.service
sudo systemctl start show-time-wifi.service
```


This setup ensures your script runs at startup and restarts automatically if it fails.
